## Live Project: [Recipeze](https://recipeze.dev)

The purpose of Recipeze is to help users build simple meals with their favorite ingredients. It's designed to make meal prep a little less monotonous. 

Search for meals by clicking on sample ingredients and then clicking the arrow button. Ideally, you should pick 1 ingredient per category. Users can also save and delete ingredients using the buttons on-screen. All ingredient preferences are saved in LocalStorage for quick access.
